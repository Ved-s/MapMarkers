Map Markers allows you to place markers on map.
Markers are stored per-player so other players on server will not see your markers, unless they set as Global.
Global markers can be edited or deleted only by their owners, or anyone if owner set marker as "Public edit" or "Public delete".
Starting with v1.1.0, multiplayer marker limit exists, it is set to 5 per player by default, this can be changed using mod's console command.
