Map Markers allows you to place markers on map.

Markers can be player-side, so only player who created them can see them,
Or they can be world-side, so everyone on server can see them.

World-side markers can be edited only by its owner, unless owner allowed marker to be edited globally.

Amount of world-side (aka Global) markers per player in multiplayer world can be edited via mod's server console command.

Starting with version 2, other mods can use MapMarkers API to create their own marker types.

Teleportation potion was removed due to item desyncs, use Wormhole potions instead.
